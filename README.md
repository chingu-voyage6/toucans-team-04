# Project idea: 

Landing page for SpaceTours - a fake space travel company.

# Description:

## **SpaceTours - a VR-based space tourism company.**

Experience space travel like you were an astronaut!
We offer virtual reality simulations that take you into an amazing interstellar journey, 
where you can see, touch and feel all of the most beautiful and exciting places of the Milky Way!

Ever wondered about climbing the peak of Olympus Mons? Or perhaps you always wanted to fly through 
Saturn's majestic ring? Maybe you daydreamed about being a space pirate?

*Now you have the possibility.* Our VR technologies are so advanced you wouldn't be able to tell 
fiction from reality. All of this online - with other people exploring space along with you, but also 
hundreds of stories written by our professional storytellers and filled with fantastic, life-like AI.

We invite you on a breathtaking trip to the stars, today!
